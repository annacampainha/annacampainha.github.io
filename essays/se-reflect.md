## Quote of the Experience 
I have many favorite quotes that motivate me to do better. Throughout my fourth year at University of Hawai'i and enduring my first Software Engineering class, I have been posting quotes that I have collected over time. For my own personal experience for Software Engineering I will make it a bit personal using my own words:

Software Engineering is hard, it challenges your brain and your ability to grow. When you feel like your brain wants to close off because the information is so new and challenging, keep going. Keep going, asking questions and never doubt yourself. The people you work with are just as new to this as you are or they once were in the place you are so keep going and never give up. *Nothing hard is easy to obtain.* Basically, hustle and remember to take breaks.

<b> growth = vulnerability + uncomfort + self-improvement; </b>
## CODING STANDARDS!

## Learn From Mistakes 

## Helper Tools

## Readability

## Conclusion
