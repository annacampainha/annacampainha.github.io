Healthy Life is a program I started when I was a Sophomore in 2018. It helps people find a balance in life to be healthy and successful. After living in the dorms, a lot of people said they wish they had help. I created a community that finds ways to fit other activities into their life. The goal of this program is to fuel your body for success. Not only is its goal to eat well but to eat well to be active and have your brain fed good food for optimal performance in school and life. 

I have gained communication skills through this because clients need to be educated on the correct form of nutrition. I have learned that many people are unaware of how to live a healthy life which leads them to be unhappy. The cycle of feeling unhappy affects the performance of many people so resources are necessary to educate the world. 

To learn more information about my nutrition program you may contact me on my personal email.
