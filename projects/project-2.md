Maze Chase is a game I developed in ICS 111, Spring 2018. The project helped me learn how to design and implement images and the platform behind making games.

Maze Chase was implemented using Java and EZ Graphics. It took one week to finish and was one of my very first experiences coding a larger project. Its a very simple program, however, I remember how much time it required and the stress.

In this project I gained experience coding and dealing with graphics. Creating the maze taught me how to use text editors to create the boundaries. I learned how to implement images into my game. I used [EZ graphics](http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dylank/ics111/) to add in the graphics.
