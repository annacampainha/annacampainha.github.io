## CODING STANDARDS!
Are coding standards helpful to Software Engineers? Yes they are! Coding standards hold you accountable to produce efficient, up to par code. Some find it tedious and unhelpful but I beg to differ for the following reasons.

## Learn From Mistakes 
I am strong believer in self exploration when struggling to solve problems. In ESLint, the errors are not inconvenient, they are helpful. They worn the user with a beautiful x that doesn’t mean “you are wrong,” instead it is elegantly warning the user there is a better way to implement the code than the way they did. It’s motivating to know that there is a tool to pick the user up when they fall. It is nice to know that there are improvements instead of not being warned and running into bugs. Coding standards hold someone accountable to fix their mistake and not develop a lazy mentality of excusing the errors. As someone uses coding standards, they get a better feel for the language that they are learning. In the end, it’s saving a lot of time and frustration. 

## Helper Tools
I also am a strong believer in working smarter, not harder. Using minimal keystrokes is a key when I code and coding standards has helpful tools that prevent more typing than needed. Instead of having to review the whole code at the end to check for minor errors, ESLint and ECMA have already pinpointed the exact errors that need to be corrected. Its helpful in developing “pretty” code rather than messy, jumbled code and which leads me into readability.

## Readability
If you are a neat, clean freak, then following coding standards are for you. The coding standards hold you account for creating clean looking code. Instead of random indentations or misaligned lines of code, ESLint guides you to a better looking program. I always get frustrated when coding if I cant figure out the issue with the alignment of my code, but ESLint makes it easier when I use Javascript. Not only does it increase readability but it improves your collaboration experience with other people and your credibility. If an unorganized person creates something, most likely that means their brain is unorganized. With ESLint, it teaches you the benefits of having organizes code. Other collaborators will find it more attractive that their partners are organized and thorough with their work instead of lazy.

##Conclusion
Overall, coding standards are beneficial. Even though its time consuming to set up, in the long run its worth it.
