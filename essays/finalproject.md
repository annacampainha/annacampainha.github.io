## Mental Health Help for STEM  majors
## Overview (including “The problem” and “The solution”)
Workout generating, mental health tips, scheduling, working on being a better self. Overall self improvment
The problem: STEM majors are put under a lot of pressure to perform and do well in school. Some people do not how to cope well with this pressure that leads to depression. Studies at the University of California, Berkeley says around 48% of STEM majors are depressed. As well as they reported there is “minimal career optimism and academic engagement” among these students. It is widely known that 1 in 4 adults will experience a fall in mental health. What causes this? From my own observation, I can tell that majority of Computer Science majors are staying up late and not getting enough sleep. Then I also hear a lot of negative comments about failing or not feeling like they are learning. 
There’s no one speaking up about this in STEM, therefore, I think it’s an ignored topic.
The solution: Create the app Healthy, Happy U at Hawai’i that is focused on providing a safe space for STEM majors. Users can create their own account and search among the app for resources. There will be an array of options to provide readings, workouts, healthy college recipes to fuel a healthy mind. Be there for STEM majors when they need it, especially thru covid. You really don’t know who needs someone during this time.

## Mockup page ideas
- landing page
- user home page
- admin home page
- vendor home page
- user profile page
- resources page
- recipe page
- search for resources page
- chatbox page for people seeking help for anything
DOESN’T REPLACE A PSYCHOLOGIST 

## Use case ideas
New user goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, sets up profile. (How do they learn how system works?)
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, gets home page, edits site, add resources, fixes bugs.
User goes to landing page, logs in, browses resources, recipes, workouts, schedule managing.

## Beyond the basics
Calendar, schedule managing
workout generator 
I think this app may already include beyond the basics implementations so I think this is a good starting point. If anyone wants to contribute, I would love it. Be the change you want to see in the world.
