## Still Figuring It Out

Software Engineering is where I want to be in my future career. I have had a hard time picking my career path throughout college, and I am excited that Software Engineering is going to help me with this. I aspire to work in Cyber Security, IT, or app development, so I am still figuring my life out. I have always been into Math and Science, but I believe software engineering is going to bring out a different characteristic in me like creativity and social collaboration. 

## Confidence is Key 

I hope to gain confidence in software engineering. I don’t know a lot about it, but from the short exposure, it seems it will help my career. I feel very uncomfortable right now while learning it, but I know that means I will grow a lot while taking this Software Engineering course. I have always attempted to make websites but failed because I didn’t have the right resources. I am hoping I will have the right resources to learn to do that. 

## Confidence and Influence

Since I stress how important confidence is, this confidence is not only for me to be a boss at what I do. I hope the confidence I gain in software engineering will give me a powerful voice in the Women in Tech community. I want to prove to myself that a woman can be an influential software engineer, just like anyone else. Hopefully it will open the doors to meeting new mentors.
