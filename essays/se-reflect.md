## Quote of the Experience 
I have many favorite quotes that motivate me to do better. Throughout my fourth year at University of Hawai'i and enduring my first Software Engineering class, I have been posting quotes that I have collected over time. For my own personal experience for Software Engineering I will make it a bit personal using my own words:

Software Engineering is hard, it challenges your brain and your ability to grow. When you feel like your brain wants to close off because the information is so new and challenging, keep going. Keep going, asking questions and never doubt yourself. The people you work with are just as new to this as you are or they once were in the place you are so keep going and never give up. *Nothing hard is easy to obtain.* Basically, hustle and remember to take breaks.

<b> growth = vulnerability + uncomfort + self-improvement; </b>
## What is Software Engineering?
Software Engineering is the part of technology that no average person will ever understand. It's the messy stuff hidden behind the pretty parts of developing software. Now there are easier ways to create software like using WordPress, but that is not for developers. What you do as a software engineer should make you start from scratch where you learn to create something cool. As I went along the journey of Software Engineering, it was complicated because of the stress I experienced but at the end its so rewarding. That is the beauty of software engineering, I can say that *I did THAT* at the end of my developments. Throughout any introductions to software engineering, I have a few *software engineering musts* that any novice developer should take the time to master. Here is a list.

<ul> 
  Functional Programming: Underscore
   Coding Standards: ESLint
  Agile Project Management: Issue Driven Project Management 
</ul>

## Underrated Underscore

## Helper Tools

## Readability

## Conclusion
