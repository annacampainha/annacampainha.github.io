## Quote of the Experience 
If you are new to reading my work, I always start my work with a quote that describes my experience.
I have many favorite quotes that motivate me to do better. Throughout my fourth year at University of Hawai'i and enduring my first Software Engineering class, I have been posting quotes that I have collected over time so I will continue that through my second Software Engineering class. Here it goes:

My mom was right, when you find what you love, you'll know.

## What Do You Know About Software Engineering?
Personally I believe Software Engineering is amazing in different aspects. Its a way to express yourself and a form of art. It is a chance to do something that not a lot of people can do-- code as an art. Of course when someone heres "Software Engineering,"  it immediately sounds intimidating. However, Software Engineering is more than a bunch of lines of code, deadlines and group meetings. I see it as a form of hope for myself and others. 
Now, if you really do not know what Software Engineering is. You can easily google "What is software engineering?" and this will appear:
"Software engineers are computer science professionals who use knowledge of engineering principles and programming languages to build software products"

Which sums it up for the most part, but let me explain to you how I have been using it in my ICS 414 Software Engineering course. My definition of Software Engineering is a bit different because my team and I just developed a new app while living in a pandemic. We have all had to learn new languages, new communication styles and many more ways to be successful in our class. We used the following key to piece together apps in our class:

Functional Programming: Underscore
Github
Meteor API
IntelliJ IDE
MongoDB
TestCafe
Coding Standards: ESLint
Agile Project Management: Issue Driven Project Management

## Conclusion
Software Engineering is my thing. I have grown so much over the semester in Software Engineering and I am so intrigued by the topics we learned. Theres so much more to it that I left out and I am excited to dig deeper as I continue this journey.
