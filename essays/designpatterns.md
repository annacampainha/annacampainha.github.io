## Quote of the Experience 
I have many favorite quotes that motivate me to do better. For experiencing Design Patterns it is quite different:
Baking is science for hungry people

I chose this quote because I just so happen to be baking dark chocolate chip cookies as I brainstormed and comprehended everything for Design Patterns. As I was making my cookies, I realized design patterns are very similar to a recipe. When someone thinks of a pattern, they most likely think of a swirl or a arithmetic sequence. In my case, I see it as a recipe. We have a goal in mind and there are guidelines that help us get to that end goal. Now, in software engineering, design patterns is reused solution like a template that is used to develop software. Recipes (especially Nestle Tollhouse Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe) can be modified by users which then results into a new recipes. Similarly, that’s how design patterns are for software. There are four different types of design patterns in software engineering which are commonly used. 
They are: 
Factory 
Singleton 
Observer 
MVC

Now I won’t go over all of them but I highly encourage familiarizing yourself with each one.

##  The gooey insides of the importance of Design Patterns
As a three and half year Computer Science student, I will be honest and say I have never heard of a design pattern in coding. This is new to me starting this semester. I understand why it is key to having a design pattern because of ultimately is the key to developing software. There are so many steps within a pattern though that you must be careful that it works as a whole. One part might be important to make the entire design work, but there are many other key elements that piece together the pattern. It’s like the flour to cookies, you need it to stick together however, other really important ingredients are the eggs and the butter. As I said, patterns need pieces that help it stick together. 

## Reality of finding the pattern in my code


## (Not So) Moral of my Quote of the Experience
Do more things, read far into them (if you are already not an over-analytical computer science nerd) and find a connection to whatever is going on in your life. You'd be surprised with how many patterns really exist in this world. 

And scientists should bake more cookies.
